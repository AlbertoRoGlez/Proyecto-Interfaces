            <p>
              To return a product purchased on the web to a store, all you have
              to do is go to the corresponding department of a store and present
              your sales document. Remember that this document is the "order
              being shipped" and "order delivered" emails, where the following
              indication is included:
            </p>

            <p>
              "This email is your sales document. If you wish to return any
              product of your order free of charge, you only have to present it
              printed or on your cell phone in a store".
            </p>

            <p>
              You don't need to bring it printed, you can show it directly from
              your cell phone.
